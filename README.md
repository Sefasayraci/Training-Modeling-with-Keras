# Training-Modeling-with-Keras


About
On this project, we will examine our test result by making local training modeling with the keras library by using the cnn layers in python with our dataset we created.

1. Dataset Preparation

The dataset that I will use in the project was not found at the level I wanted, although I scanned it as a result of the articles written, but since it is in csv extension type, I will add it to the additional file section below for your benefit.

That's why I collected my own data. In my project, I made it ready for both test and training modeling for the Sun and the Moon, and I used two software classes for this.

I am sharing it as an additional file both in the code part and in the last part to be an example from a certain part of the dataset I have used.
